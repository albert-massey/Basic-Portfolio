        <p id="bio">Hi there. :) My name is Albert Snowlove. I am a Full Stack Web Developer and I love creating beautiful elegant and intelligent interfaces. I am big on design and aesthectics. I am also a huge fan of Steve Jobs. In my free time I watch documentaries on Netflix. I also like working out and be in shape. I love swimming since it is low impact and easy on your joints. I also idolize Micheal Phelps. For me his story is a huge inspiration. I am also nature lover and I second ecofriendly stuff. My dream car is Tesla Model X. I am so impressed by the CEO Elon Musk and for me he is the real world Iron Man.</p>
        <p id="bio2">I have designed and developed my website called <a id="web" href="codemartian.com" target="_blank">codemartian.com</a>. It is like my playground for the web where I practise new skills and publish my work and projects I have worked on. A few things I am working on right now are JavaScript, jQuery, BootStrap, Accessibility, Responsivness and MySQL. I am also enrolled in University of Washington Coding Boot Camp.</p>
        <p id="bio3">"My longterm goals include having my own little startup which will solve real world problems with the aid of technology. Somewhat like Tesla. Doing so I would be able to appease my inner urge to make the world a better place as well as make me feel technically accomplished.</p>
